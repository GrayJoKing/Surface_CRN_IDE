# Surface_CRN_IDE
An IDE for developing Surface CRNs built for the web browser

A little bit of a mess right now, but essentially this repository should contain two packages.

* surface_crn: For pure Surface CRN simulations
* surface_crn_ide: An IDE for development built using React

Neither of these are complete right now.
